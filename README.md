# Search-Replace
Search &amp; Replace!
- Finds and searched for some word in a text file and replaces every instance of it! 
 
## How to use it:
- Compile the code and run main!

## Included Files:
- The whole Shrek script. 
- The Bible's Chapter Genesis
- Feel free to add more: create a .txt file with your contents, name it and plop it in the folder and have fun messing around with this!

## Why?
- I really just got bored, and wanted to practice C and working with files.
